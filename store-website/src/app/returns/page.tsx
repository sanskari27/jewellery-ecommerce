						immediately upon its receipt with a valid reason. From the time of receiving the product
						(tracked via courier delivery), you have 24 hours to provide satisfactory proof (Video
						proof) of return dispatch to claim your refund. No returns will be accepted after 24
						hours of receiving the product.

						Your refund amount depends on the condition of the product upon return. If the product
						is damaged, torn, or if any items/parts are missing (such as diamonds, pearls, stones,
						etc.), the repairing charges will be deducted from the principal amount, and delivery
						charges will also be deducted.
